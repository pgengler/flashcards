# Flashcard
Flashcards is a simple flashcard-like app. No doubt there are many others like it but this is mine.

## How does it work?
You create "cards" which have "front" and "back" content. By default the "front" is shown and you can click the card to toggle front/back.

One way to use this is to put the "unknown" thing (or the thing you want to review) on the front of the card and the answer or any notes on the back. This way you can quickly go through the fronts and pause to review the backs as needed.

## Anything else to know?
There's no authentication at all; anyone who can see a card can add new ones, edit existing ones or remove them. This is not meant to be a public-facing thing but should work well when run locally.
